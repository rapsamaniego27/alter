feature_left_description: Currently, I lead a band called Folk Ridge which
  specializes on Country, Folk and Rock n Roll music. It was a rough start but I
  managed to get the group established and find common people. I have a vision
  to make our preferred genres great again and introduce it to young gen and
  re-live the music into the oldies.
